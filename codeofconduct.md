The Executive Committee of the Western States Sections of The Combustion Institute
approved this Code of Conduct, March 24th, 2019. This document complements the Code
of Ethics adopted by the Board of Directors of The Combustion Institute, 23 March 2017.

The Western States Section of The Combustion Institute (WSSCI) is committed to providing
a safe environment for all its members and meeting attendees free from unlawful harassment.
Harassment in any form, based on sex, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual 
orientation, age, disability, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), medical 
condition, pregnancy, or any other protected characteristics recognized by law, is a 
violation of the Code of Conduct. Everyone should be treated with respect without fear 
of discrimination, quid pro quo, or condescension whether blatant or via micro‐aggressions. 
This policy applies to all WSSCI members and covers behavior that takes place at any programs 
or activities associated with The Combustion Institute.

## Reporting an Incident of Violation of the Code of Conduct

The WSSCI takes all reports of behavior prohibited by the Code of Conduct seriously 
and encourages any individual who experiences or witnesses such behavior to report,
including anonymously, such violations to the Chair or the Vice‐Chair of the WSSCI, 
including by email ([conduct@wssci.us](mailto:conduct@wssci.us?subject=[Code of Conduct])).
The WSSCI encourages the prompt reporting of such matters to ensure a timely and
constructive resolution.

The Chair and Vice‐Chair will evaluate each report to determine the most appropriate 
response, including both informal and formal responses, in accordance with the rights of 
each party. The desired response of the reporting party will be taken into account but 
cannot be determinative of the WSSCI’s response. In meeting with the reporting party, 
the Chair and the Vice‐Chair will explain that reports will be handled with sensitivity 
and kept as confidential as possible to respect the privacy of all parties.

Informal and formal responses are initiated to stop the prohibited behavior and prevent 
its reoccurrence. Possible responses and outcomes include, but are not limited to, 
issuing a warning to cease the behavior before further sanctions are pursued; separation 
of the involved persons; exclusion from the remainder of the current and/or future programs 
and activities; and, revoking membership. The WSSCI will maintain a record of the report 
and corresponding response.

Any person who experiences or witnesses prohibited behavior also has reporting options 
outside of the WSSCI, including filing a report with their home institution or the police.

## Retaliation

The WSSCI does not tolerate any kind of retaliation against an individual filing a 
report or assisting in the resolution of a report of prohibited behavior (even if no 
responsive action is taken). Retaliation is a violation of the Code of Conduct. 
The WSSCI takes reports of retaliation very seriously. Anyone who experiences or 
witnesses retaliation in any form should report it immediately to the Chair and the 
Vice Chair.
